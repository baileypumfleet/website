          Early on in life, I realised I wanted to build things. I learned to
          code when I was 8 - it was a great medium for me to be able to build
          something from scratch by myself. A good few years went on, and I was
          starting web hosting companies, and over the next few years, I
          transitioned into building SaaS, which was what I truly loved.

          Whilst building various SaaS apps, I realised that scheduling was a
          problem that was not being solved well. In direct response to this
          challenge, I started Cal.com with my co-founder Peer when I was 17,
          originally as a side project.

          personal scheduling links. Hence, we looked at a rebrand and acquired
